I"t<p>In April 2008, Zimbabwe promulgated the Indigenisation and Economic Empowerment Act No. 14 of 2007 (Chapter 14:33). The background to the law was the need to restructure and transform Zimbabwe’s economy.
In the early 1990s, indigenisation policy produced big businessmen like Strive Masiiwa and Ben Mucheche. And yet, when Hon Kasukuwere under the late Robert Mugabe’s government forged ahead with implementing the programme he was excoriated for his efforts.In this episode, Cde Kasukuwere explains the origins and motivations of Zimbabwe’s indigenisation and economic empowerment programme.</p>
