In April 2008, Zimbabwe promulgated the Indigenisation and Economic Empowerment Act No. 14 of 2007 (Chapter 14:33). The background to the law was the need to restructure and transform Zimbabwe's economy.

In this episode, Cde Kasukuwere explains the origins and motivations of Zimbabwe's indigenisation and economic empowerment programme.

Intro music is "Kumatendera" by Mbira DzeNharira. Outro is "Ndega ndega" by Mbuya Madhuve.
