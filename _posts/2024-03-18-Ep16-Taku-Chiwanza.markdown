This episode was recorded with Cde Takudzwa Chiwanza in September 2023 soon after the harmonised elections in Zimbabwe, however, I couldnt publish it owing to circumstances beyond my control. Notwithstanding this, the issues we covered are still relevant today.

Outro music is "Ndega ndega" by Mbuya Madhuve.
