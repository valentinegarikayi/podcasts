Since independence in 1980, Zimbabwe’s ruling ZANU–PF has shaped a society marked by deepening class divides. Outside the political elite, a wealthy class has risen. Examples include figures like Strive Masiyiwa and Kudakwashe Tagwirei. At the same time, the once-stable professional class of teachers, nurses, and clerks has steadily declined. Today, a small middle class survives alongside peasants, vendors, and artisanal miners facing harsh realities.

In this episode, I sit down with Comrade Benny Moyo to explore class in Zimbabwe from the rise of the elite to the search for a revolutionary class.
