<h2 class="label">About Zim Left Radio</h2>

Welcome to Zim Left Radio, a podcast dedicated to left-wing analysis of Zimbabwe’s economy and society.
<p>
Almost everyday we are told Zimbabwe’s sociol-economic problems are a result of economic mismanagement and corruption.
<p>
Or, if you are aligned to the ruling party, Zimbabwe’s problems are a result of sanctions.
<p>
Whilst both arguments are probably partially correct, I think that they do not give a complete picture.
<p>
In fact there remains many open questions, for example, if sanctions are that bad why did Rhodesia and more recently Russia do well under economic sanctions?
<p>
If mismanagement is indeed the problem, with Mthuli Ncube, a Cambridge graduate and Oxford professor as finance minister why has Zimbabwe’s economy not improved? Surely there can be no better managers than an Oxford professor or are there any?
<p>
In this podcast, I will explore many topics using a Marxist-Leninist perspective to give you an alternative view.
<p>
My aim is to provide a voice to the voiceless, and inspire the downtroddem to take actions to improve their living conditions.
