African economies remain among the least developed in the world, despite more than six decades since the wave of independence that ended formal colonial rule across much of the continent.

In this episode, I sit down with Comrade Ian Beddowes of the Zimbabwe Communist Party to explore the question of Africa’s development. We take a close look at the Zimbabwean economy and discuss why a one-sided focus on “human rights,” as promoted by imperialist powers and former colonial masters obscures deeper structural issues.

In the final segment, we reflect on the enduring legacy of David Stirling, the founder of Britain’s Special Air Service (SAS), and what his influence reveals about the persistence of imperial power.
