Land reform in Africa remains one of the most explosive debates of our time—who owns the land, who works it, and who truly benefits?

In this episode, I sit down with Comrade Ian Beddowes of the Zimbabwe Communist Party to dissect the continent’s turbulent history of land redistribution.

We’ll compare different African models, but focus sharply on Zimbabwe’s radical reform program—a policy that toppled white settler dominance, crashed the economy, and still sparks fury and admiration today.

Was it economic suicide or long-overdue justice? And what lessons does it hold for South Africa, Kenya, and beyond?

Outro music is "Buka Tiende" by Thomas Mapfumo.
