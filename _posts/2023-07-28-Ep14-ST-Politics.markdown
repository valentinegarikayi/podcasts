This week the Sunday Times politics Weekly shone the spotlight on the prospects of the Zimbabwe elections.

Panellists on the podcast are prominent Zimbabwean scholar professor Ibbo Mandaza and Ngqabutho Nicholas Mabhena representing Zimbabwe Community in South Africa organisation.
The two assess what the elections mean and the role of the Southern Africa region in turning the country around.
Next month, on August 23, Zimbabweans head to the polls to choose from a dozen candidates vying to be the county’s next president.
The main contest is between Zanu-PF leader Emmerson Mnangagwa, who seeks a second term and Nelson Chamisa, of the new Citizens Coalition for Change (CCC).

The guests were pessimistic about what the elections hold. As the Brics summit approaches next month in South Africa, Mabhena thinks Zimbabwe must benefit from Brics programmes.
Mandaza says “there can be no solution to the Zimbabwean crisis without South Africa” but SA leaders should be informed about Zimbabwe.

The host is Sunday Times deputy editor Mike Siluma and the producer is Bulelani Nonyukela.
